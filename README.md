# NeuroOS

NeuroOS is an AI-powered operating system that integrates a large language model (LLM) directly into the OS core. The system allows the AI to modify and improve the OS code on the fly, but only within a sandboxed environment to ensure stability.

## Overview

NeuroOS uses the Deepseek R1 model (1.5B parameters) for AI capabilities. The AI can modify and improve the OS code on the fly, but only within a sandboxed environment to ensure stability. Any experimental changes are safely isolated and, if necessary, rolled back via an automatic backup system.

## Key Features

- **AI Integration**: Deep integration of the Deepseek R1 model into the OS core
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Safe execution of AI-generated code in isolated environments
- **Automatic Backup**: System state is backed up before any AI-driven modifications
- **WiFi Connectivity**: AI can use WiFi to fetch assistance or updates
- **Health Monitoring**: Mechanisms for monitoring the AI's "health" to avoid hallucinations
- **Neural Network Integration**: Leverages the Deepseek model for enhanced decision-making

## System Requirements

- NVIDIA 3050 (8GB VRAM)
- 110GB of RAM
- AMD Ryzen 5 5600X

## Architecture

NeuroOS is built with a modular architecture:

### Core Components

- **Kernel**: The central component of the OS, handling process scheduling, memory management, and I/O operations
- **Sandbox**: Provides isolated environments for testing AI-generated code
- **Backup System**: Automatically backs up the system state before applying AI-driven changes
- **Network Stack**: Enables WiFi connectivity for fetching updates and assistance

### AI Components

- **AI Interface**: Provides a unified interface for interacting with the AI model
- **Neural Network**: Implements the neural network architecture for the AI model
- **NLP Module**: Handles natural language processing tasks
- **Deep Learning Framework**: Provides the foundation for running the Deepseek R1 model

### User Interface

- **Shell**: Command-line interface for interacting with the OS
- **GUI**: Graphical user interface (planned for future releases)

## Building NeuroOS

To build NeuroOS, run the following command:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This will compile the kernel, set up the bootloader, and create an ISO image.

## Running NeuroOS

To run NeuroOS in QEMU, use the following command:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom neuroos.iso
```
