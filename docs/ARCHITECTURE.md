# NeuroOS Architecture

This document describes the architecture of NeuroOS, including the core components, modules, and how they interact with each other.

## Overview

NeuroOS is an AI-powered operating system that integrates a large language model (LLM) directly into the OS core. The system allows the AI to modify and improve the OS code on the fly, but only within a sandboxed environment to ensure stability.

## Core Components

### Kernel

The kernel is the central component of NeuroOS. It handles process scheduling, memory management, device drivers, file systems, and other low-level operations. The kernel is designed to be modular, allowing for easy extension and modification.

Key features:
- Process scheduling
- Memory management
- Device drivers
- File systems
- System calls
- Interrupt handling
- IPC (Inter-Process Communication)

### Sandbox

The sandbox provides isolated environments for testing AI-generated code. It ensures that any experimental changes are safely isolated from the rest of the system.

Key features:
- Process isolation
- Resource limits
- Security policies
- Rollback capabilities

### Backup System

The backup system automatically backs up the system state before applying AI-driven changes. It allows for easy rollback if the changes cause issues.

Key features:

The network stack enables WiFi connectivity for fetching updates and assistance. It provides a comprehensive set of networking capabilities, including socket operations, interface management, and protocol implementations.

Key features:
- Socket operations
- Interface management
- Protocol implementations (TCP, UDP, HTTP, etc.)
- WiFi connectivity
- DNS resolution
- DHCP client

## AI Components

### AI Interface

The AI Interface provides a unified API for interacting with the AI model. It abstracts away the details of the underlying neural network and NLP modules, providing a simple interface for the rest of the OS to use.

## User Interface

### Shell

The shell provides a command-line interface for interacting with the OS. It allows users to execute commands, run scripts, and manage the system.

2. **Sandboxing**: AI-generated code is tested in a sandboxed environment before being applied to the system.

3. **Backup and Rollback**: The system state is backed up before any changes are applied, allowing for easy rollback if issues arise.

4. **Access Control**: The system implements access control mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive resources.

5. **Secure Boot**: The system implements secure boot to ensure that only trusted code is executed during the boot process.

6. **Encryption**: The system supports encryption for sensitive data and communications.

7. **Auditing**: The system logs security-relevant events for later analysis.

## Conclusion

NeuroOS is designed to be a modular, extensible, and secure operating system with deep AI integration. Its architecture allows for easy extension and modification, while its security model ensures that the system remains stable and secure.
